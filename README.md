<h2>BMAS</h2>
<h3>Black Mesa Research Facility Announcement System</h3>
<br>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is the Black Mesa Announcement System that they use at Black Mesa Research Facility in Half-Life.</p>
<p>This code looks for a new video from twitter.com/BMRF_ALERTS, takes the video and downloads it and </p>
<p>save it onto your hard drive and plays the video with VLC.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How do I run this?</h3>
<p>First you will need to modify BMAS.py and enter your Twitter API credentials.</p>
<p>Then look in the code and if you want to use this for anything else but BMRF_ALERTS</p>
<p>you can do so by editing this line <b>account_to_watch = "BMRF_ALERTS"</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>Now you got everything set up and now you can run the script with <b>python BMAS.py start</b>.</p>
<p>To stop the script, type <b>python BMAS.py stop</b>.</p>
